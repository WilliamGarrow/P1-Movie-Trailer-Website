A browser window will open and render the Nicolas Cage top 10 'Cagey' flicks of all time in glorious CSS animation. A click on a movie poster thumbnail will open the preview trailer in a modal. 

## Project Description
In this project you will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see your favorite movies and watch the trailers. You'll be writing server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. The data will then be expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers. (Here's a hint: The data for the movies will be stored using Classes!)

#### Project Evaluation (Rubric)
The project will be evaluated on a Does Not Meet Specifications, Meets Specifications, and Exceeds Specifications scale. While every criteria will have a does not meet and meets category, not every criteria will have an exceeds option.

The rubric is broken into four major categories: Functionality, Code Quality, Comments, and Documentation.
